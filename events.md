# M-x Research Events

Join our meetups @ [bit.ly/mxresearch](bit.ly/mxresearch) @ 3pm UTC/BST

## Demo and discuss: lsp-mode
### 6th August 2020
RSEs often need to work with multiple programming languages. The Language Server Protocol (originally from Visual Studio Code) was designed to allow multiple language backends to provide a consistent interface to code completion, refactoring, jumping to symbol definitions, syntax highlighting, error messages etc. The lsp-mode package bring the power of LSP to the emacs world. @Chris Cave-Ayland has kindly agreed to lead an interactive demonstration to introduce lsp-mode, followed by opening the floor for an open discussion on using of lsp-mode to create a consistent development experience across multiple languages.
## Live code: M-x Research
### 20th August 2020
Following on from our introduction to elisp (thanks @jjensenral), in this session we'll give those new to programming emacs a chance to see some customisation using elisp in practice. This will be an interactive session, in which we'll build up some simple functions in elisp. We'll build a package for connecting to our Zoom talks from Emacs, with a few extra bells and whistles. The aim of this session is to build confidence to start writing your own elisp functions or to understand functions that you will find in the wild.
## Demo and discuss: org-babel
### 3rd September 2020
Org-babel is a powerful extension to org-mode which allows embedding executable code snippets into org documents. Org-babel allows a multi-language computing environment using literate programming techniques, particularly for reproducible research. This results in an environment similar to Jupyter notebooks or RMarkdown, but with the advantage of being able to pass data between multiple languages. @tlestang has kindly agreed to lead a demonstration of the basic features of org-babel, followed by opening the floor for an open discussion on the uses of org-babel for reproducible research.
## Ideas: I wish I'd known sooner...
### 17th September 2020
If you could pass one nuggets of emacs wisdom to your former self, what would it be? In this session, we'll be inviting people to share what their nugget of wisdom would be, be it a command, an editing trick or a philosophy. All contributions are welcome, and in order for the format to work, we'll need to have volunteers. If you come across a promising "nugget of wisdom" over the next weeks, please consider volunteering. I suggest that volunteers drop me a direct message, to avoid spoilers in the channel.
## Demo and discuss: Magit and version control
### 1st October: 2020
Magit is a quick, comfortable and advanced interface to git from inside emacs. With a bit of familiarity, version controlling projects can become both easy and powerful. @mose has kindly agreed to demonstrate the use of magit in emacs to stay in control of version control. As in previous sessions, this will be an interactive demonstration, followed by a discussion of magit and version control tips, tricks and tools in emacs. (edited)
