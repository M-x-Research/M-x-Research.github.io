Our last post in the site was from January 2022!! That's almost two years ago.
Most probably, whoever who visited this site in that time thought we were not
doing anything anymore. But that's not true!

In 2023 we've continued with [Jens Jensen's functional programming
lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcMjpsudwvnG0ePHdNqRmIwKVNWCTdSE9),
our sessions of Show & Tell where Vidianos has been the most active presenter!
Some of us were lucky enough to meet in person at some of the RSE events. 

Last week, during our last meeting of the year we used that time to plan what's
next for the coming year. This time we've not been so ambitious with what we
planned for 2022 (however, we can still [take from that list if we lose
inspiration](/2022/01/21/a-new-year.html#what-activities-can-we-do)).

Remember that we have our events announced on our [Google
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=bzB0aWFkbGpwNWRxN2xrYjUxbW52bnJoMDRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
and [mobilizon](https://mobilizon.fr/@m_x_research). You can talk with us on
[`[matrix]`](https://matrix.to/#/#M-x-Research:matrix.org) (or Slack if you are
in [UKRSE](https://ukrse.slack.com/archives/CDBHZCDQE))

## What we will do in 2024

### Activities

- [ ] Finnish the functional programming lectures by Jens - there are two left! And monads are coming in the next one (on 10th Jan)
- [ ] Continue the Tell & Show to share how we use emacs to approach the problems we have

### Community

- [X] Have a mastodon presence (DONE: [@Mx_Reseaerch@emacs.cs](https://emacs.ch/@Mx_Research))
- [ ] Migrate this blog to org-mode [#3](https://github.com/M-x-Research/M-x-Research.github.io/issues/3) - Blaine has volunteered to explore that! ðŸ™Œ
- [ ] Update this blog more frequently with short summaries of what we've discussed.
- [ ] Setup the RSS feed for the blog.
- [X] Remove password from joining our meetings.
  - [ ] Continue testing jitsi as an alternative (so can be managed by more than just me).

Let us know about your emacs personal goals for 2024 to push your research forward and we may be able to help each other!
