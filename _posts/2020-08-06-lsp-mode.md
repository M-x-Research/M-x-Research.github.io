# lsp-mode demo
#### 2020-08-06

## Context
RSEs often need to work with multiple programming languages. The Language Server Protocol (originally from Visual Studio Code) was designed to allow multiple language backends to provide a consistent interface to code completion, refactoring, jumping to symbol definitions, syntax highlighting, error messages etc. The lsp-mode package bring the power of LSP to the emacs world.

## Meetup Notes

- Talk website: https://cc-a.github.io/lsp-mode-demo
- Defines an open standard for communication between an IDE/editor and an external service implementing programming assistance
    - Multiple languages can have a relatively consistent interface (e.g. keybindings)
    - Developed by MS as part of VSCode but an open standard and widely adopted
    - Reduces implementation effort from n√óm to n+m (n language servers, m editors)
    - It's been very successful, supports a large number of languages, and in some cases multiple server implementations for the same language. Tables: [languages](https://langserver.org/#implementations-server), [editors](https://langserver.org/#implementations-client)
- *Aside:* if you use spacemacs, add the `lsp` layer plus whichever language layers you need (spacemacs `develop` branch only). Likewise `Doom` emacs has an `lsp` layer, and a `+lap` option for the `debugger` layer.

## Demonstration
### Config file
Start the demo emacs config by using the config file [provided here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-a/lsp-mode-demo/master/.emacs).
- The config file shows some use-package commands in comments to install dependencies
- use-package has been configured with hooks for python-mode and f90-mode
- Config file configures
    - Company
    - flycheck
    - lsp-mode and lsp-ui (for pop-ups, hovers, minibuffer)
    
### Python demosration
- Open demo.py from the repository
- Errors and warnings are shown inline the extreme right hand side of the buffer, in what is know as the `sideline`
- If you have installed an lsp server for the language, you'll see a message about the server starting when you open a buffer
- `lsp-mode` is used for completion (try typing `datetime.` followed by `TAB`)
- Completions are documented in a hover
- Opening the brackets creates a minibuffer with the function documentation
- you can format the code using lsp-formatter
- you can jump to definition `ctrl` `.` (right?)
- Chris demonstrated a more advance, opinionated config shown at the bottom of the config file. This some options for:
    - Smaller documentation popups
    - Hover text in sideline
    - Disabling auto-display of documentation

### Other questions / discussion

- lsp runs locally, it doesn't need of the internet! It typically uses the introspection in each language.
- lsp needs of an external server installed for each language. You can install the ones you like.
- there are ways to have it for different environments, but normally you need the python language server in that env. Some possibilities are:
    - [dir-locals](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Directory-Local-Variables.html) ([a quick guide](https://endlessparentheses.com/a-quick-guide-to-directory-local-variables.html))
    - [pyenv](https://github.com/pythonic-emacs/pyenv-mode)
    - No emacs: [direnv](https://direnv.net/); [emacs-direnv](https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-direnv)
- `eglot` is a lightweight alternative to `lsp-mode`
- The debugger server looks cool (`dap-mode`)!
